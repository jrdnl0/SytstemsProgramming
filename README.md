# ECE2220 | C & Unix (Formerly Known as Systems Programming)

Author: Jacob Reese Daniel



## Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to allow my fellow students (or anyone else interested) to view the project(s) and work I've done for this course. I additionally plan to make a 
similar repository for the prupose of the ECE2730 / Computer Organization Lab, which deals Assembly Language, so keep an eye out for that.

This course contains a multitude of "programming projects" that are designed to teach one about the multiple aspects of the C programming language, and some of them can be *quite* challenging, especially for 
students that don't have much experience in lower-level programming. So a partial bit of this repository's purpose is to perhaps inspire and display some of the ways someone else solved these problems.



## Disclaimer:

Unfortunately, I do have to be careful about academic policy and anything that may entail cheating being associated with this repository. So here is my fair warning:

**THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT DESIGNINED TO BE A COPY-PASTE ZONE. NOT ONLY DO MOST OF THE PROJECTS NOT GET RE-USED, BUT IT IS ALSO A DISSERVICE TO YOURSELF TO CHEAT IN THIS CLASS. YOU WILL MOST LIKELY BE CAUGHT AS THIS REPOSITORY IS PUBLIC.
IF YOU ARE CAUGHT USING THIS REPOSITORY IN AN ACADEMICALLY DISHONEST MANNER -- I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE!**

Low-level programming is a critical (and valuable) skill in the modern era of programmers, and I guarantee that being proficient in C, Assembly, and C++ on an intimate level will pay dividends back over time.


### Last Update:
As of writing this (3/3/25), I plan to add more files containing project descriptions, brief overviews, and the like! Stay tuned ;)
